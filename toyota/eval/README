Pre-campaign target audience assessment (EVAL)
----------------------------------------------
   Client can do an pre-assessment and compare as to how many people they are
      reaching out to before committing on the type of channel.

   Client is able to do a query such as number of people who 'Liked' Zales.

   Client is able to do query on size of segment in Cheetahmail and check 
      against the target group on FB.

   Client can show demographic breakup on Mosaic.

   Client can query on target group on Techlightenment.

   Client can show On CheetahMail what current campaign other people are running 
      and what volume they are sending so Client can run something more effective.

   Pre-campaign and traffic: can see when subscribers use which channel, 
      e.g. during work time, subscribers would probably be at work and not on FB
           so reach them using email. After office hours, we use FB

   Hitwise demographic to map to figure out subscriber locations and details
